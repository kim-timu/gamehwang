# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web-based retro game arcade. It provides a central lobby where users can browse and select from a collection of classic retro games. The goal is to create a nostalgic and engaging experience by recreating beloved games from the past.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application, serving as the game selection lobby.
- `tetris.html`: The page for the Tetris game.
- `coming-soon.html`: A placeholder page for games that are not yet implemented.
