# Blueprint: Minesweeper Game

## Overview

A classic Minesweeper game built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player's goal is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them.

## Design and Style

*   **Layout:** A compact layout featuring game controls (difficulty, restart) and game info (mine count, timer) above the main game board.
*   **Theme:** A "Neumorphic" design, using soft shadows to create a plastic, extruded look.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Background: A light gray (`#f0f2f5`).
    *   Cells: A slightly darker gray (`#e0e5ec`) with inset and outset shadows to show depth.
    *   Mines: Red (`#d32f2f`).
    *   Flags: Orange (`#f57c00`).
*   **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif font (Poppins).

## Features

*   **Game Board:** A dynamic grid of cells generated by JavaScript.
*   **Difficulty Levels:**
    *   Easy: 9x9 grid with 10 mines.
    *   Medium: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
    *   Hard: 16x30 grid with 99 mines.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   **Left-click:** Reveals a cell. If the cell is a mine, the game is over. If the cell is empty (0 adjacent mines), it recursively reveals all neighboring empty cells.
    *   **Right-click:** Flags or un-flags a cell as a potential mine.
*   **First-Click Safety:** The first cell clicked in any game is guaranteed not to be a mine.
*   **Game Timer:** A timer starts on the first click and tracks the game duration.
*   **Mine Counter:** Displays the total number of mines minus the number of flags placed.
*   **Win/Loss Condition:**
    *   **Loss:** The player loses if they click on a mine. All mines are revealed.
    *   **Win:** The player wins by revealing all non-mine cells.

## Development Plan

3.  **[Completed]** **Core Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement board generation and difficulty settings.
    *   Implement mine placement with first-click safety.
    *   Calculate adjacent mine counts for all cells.
4.  **[Completed]** **Interaction Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement left-click (reveal) and right-click (flag) functionality.
    *   Implement recursive reveal for empty cells.
5.  **[Completed]** **Game State (`main.js`):**
