# Blueprint: Minesweeper Game

## Overview

A classic Minesweeper game built with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player's goal is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them.

## Design and Style

*   **Layout:** A compact layout featuring game controls (difficulty, restart) and game info (mine count, timer) above the main game board.
*   **Theme:** A "Neumorphic" design, using soft shadows to create a plastic, extruded look.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Background: A light gray (`#f0f2f5`).
    *   Cells: A slightly darker gray (`#e0e5ec`) with inset and outset shadows to show depth.
    *   Mines: Red (`#d32f2f`).
    *   Flags: Orange (`#f57c00`).
*   **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif font (Poppins).

## Features

*   **Game Board:** A dynamic grid of cells generated by JavaScript.
*   **Progressive Levels:** The game starts on 'Easy' (9x9, 10 mines). Upon winning, it automatically progresses to 'Medium' (16x16, 40 mines), and then 'Hard' (16x30, 99 mines). After the final level, the game resets.
*   **Gameplay:**
    *   **Left-click:** Reveals a cell. If the cell is a mine, the game is over. If the cell is empty (0 adjacent mines), it recursively reveals all neighboring empty cells.
    *   **Right-click:** Flags or un-flags a cell as a potential mine.
*   **First-Click Safety:** The first cell clicked in any game is guaranteed not to be a mine.
*   **Game Timer:** A timer starts on the first click and tracks the game duration.
*   **Mine Counter:** Displays the total number of mines minus the number of flags placed.
*   **Win/Loss Condition:**
    *   **Loss:** The player loses if they click on a mine. All mines are revealed.
    *   **Win:** The player wins by revealing all non-mine cells, which triggers the next level.

## Development Plan

1.  **[Completed]** **Structure (`index.html`):** Create the main HTML structure for the game board, controls, and info panel, removing the difficulty selector.
2.  **[Completed]** **Styling (`style.css`):** Implement the full visual design, including the neumorphic theme and cell styles.
3.  **[Completed]** **Core Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement board generation and a progressive level system.
    *   Implement mine placement with first-click safety.
    *   Calculate adjacent mine counts for all cells.
4.  **[Completed]** **Interaction Logic (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement left-click (reveal) and right-click (flag) functionality.
    *   Implement recursive reveal for empty cells.
5.  **[Completed]** **Game State (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement the timer.
    *   Implement the win/loss conditions and end-game display, including level progression.
